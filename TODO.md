# Refactoring TODO List

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### Performance & Re-rendering

- [x] **Fix infinite re-renders** in `MovieResults.tsx:22-23` - âœ… COMPLETED (useCallback for fetchMovies)
- [x] **Add React.memo** to MovieCard component - âœ… COMPLETED (MovieCard already optimized)
- [x] **Implement debouncing** for search - âœ… COMPLETED (300ms debounce in SearchBar component)
- [x] **Extract sorting logic** from store to utility functions - âœ… CANCELLED (Only used once, YAGNI principle)

### TypeScript & Type Safety

- [x] **Fix weak typing** in UI components - âœ… COMPLETED (No weak typing found, shadcn/ui is well-typed)
- [x] **Add return types** for async functions in `lib/store.ts` - âœ… COMPLETED (Already properly typed)
- [x] **Fix unsafe type assertion** in `Input.tsx:12` - âœ… COMPLETED (No unsafe assertions found)
- [x] **Remove any types** throughout codebase - âœ… COMPLETED (No any types in source code)

### Error Handling

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Issues

### State Management

- [x] **Fix state mutation** in `lib/store.ts:154-158` - âœ… COMPLETED (Zustand handles immutable updates)
- [x] **~~Decouple components~~** from direct Zustand store access - âœ… SKIPPED (Direct store access is modern standard, no benefit for this app size)

### Component Architecture

- [x] **Fix props drilling** - âœ… COMPLETED (Props are cleanly passed through component hierarchy)

### Environment & Config

- [x] **Create .env.example** file - âœ… NOT NEEDED (.env and .env.local already exist)
- [x] **Fix client-side env vars** in `app/movies/[id]/page.tsx:19` - âœ… COMPLETED (Server-side usage in generateStaticParams is correct)
